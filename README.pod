lib::safe - check that none of the dirs in @INC is writable by the current user

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # silently skips over writable directories
    use lib::safe;

    # croaks on the first writable directory encounterd
    use lib::safe "strict";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an experimental pragma to somehow provide a better solution
for the CVS-2016-1238 problem.

This module installs a C<require> hook in C<@INC> which checks whether
directories in C<@INC> are writable. Be default, if a directory is detected
as writable, it is skipped over. When the C<strict> option is enabled,
a writable directory trigger an exception.
